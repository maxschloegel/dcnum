        """Sparse median background correction with cleansing

        In contrast to the rolling median background correction,
        this algorithm only computes the background image every
        `split_time` seconds, but with a larger window (default kernel size is
        200 frames instead of 100 frames).

        1. At time stamps every `split_time` seconds, a background image is
           computed, resulting in a background series.
        2. Cleansing: The background series is checked for images that
           contain event data using a lengthy algorithm that is documented
           in the source code (sorry). In short, this gets rid of
           background images that contain streaks of RBCs.
        3. Each frame gets the background image closest to it
           based on time from the background series.

        Parameters
        ----------
        input_data: array-like or pathlib.Path
            The input data can be either a path to an HDF5 file with
            the "evtens/image" dataset or an array-like object that
            behaves like an image stack (first axis enumerates events).
        output_path: pathlib.Path
            Path to the output file. If `input_data` is a path, you can
            set `output_path` to the same path to write directly to the
            input file. The data are written in the "events/image_bg"
            dataset in the output file.
        kernel_size: int
            Kernel size for median computation. This is the number of
            events that are used to compute the median for each pixel.
        split_time: float
            Time between background images in the background series
        thresh_cleansing: float
            A positive floating point value for scaling the thresholding
            operation when excluding background images from the series.
            Larger values mean more background images are excluded.
            Set to zero to enforce a fixed fraction via `frac_cleansing`.
        frac_cleansing: float
            Fraction between 0 and 1 indicating how many background images
            must still be present after cleansing (in case the cleansing
            factor is too large). Set to 1 to disable cleansing altogether.
        compress: bool
            Whether to compress background data. Set this to False
            for faster processing.
        num_cpus: int
            Number of CPUs to use for median computation. Defaults to
            `multiprocessing.cpu_count()`.
